# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
 
This Project is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course via Coursera.

This data comes from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

  
The documents include:
A. run_analysis.R --> the code performing analyses below:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
B. CodeBook.md --> the instructions describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work to clean up the data.

C. TidyDataSet.txt --> the output of this project.
